# License-Plate-Detection
## Aim
## Algorithm
### Step 1:
Import the usual libraries you think you'll need.
### Step 2:
Read in the car_plate.jpg file from the DATA folder.
### Step 3:
Create a function that displays the image in a larger scale and correct coloring for matplotlib.
### Step 4:
Load the haarcascade_russian_plate_number.xml file.
### Step 5:
Create a function that takes in an image and draws a rectangle around what it detects to be a license plate. Keep in mind we're just drawing a rectangle around it for now, later on we'll adjust this function to blur. You may want to play with the scaleFactor and minNeighbor numbers to get good results.
### Step 6:
Edit the function so that is effectively blurs the detected plate, instead of just drawing a rectangle around it.
